# Hi, I’m Alex Hoare!

I'm a .NET developer recently graduated from King's College London with a Masters in Advanced Computing, and an undergraduate degree from the University of Leeds in Computer Science.

I have experience mainly in C#, with working knowledge/experience in C/C++, Python, LUA, Java and Kotlin.

I'm currently looking for opportunities as a backend software developer using the .NET framework.

# Contributions

As of 21/10/2021 I have been contibuting to an open-source project, [Path of Building](https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding), helping to update the build planner for the latest features added in Path of Exile 3.16 (Scourge).

# Academic papers

I have written two academic papers, one for my Masters which involves Artificial Intelligences playing card games, and the other for my undergraduate which helped explore optimised interior layouts using procedural generation.

### An Empirical Analysis of Personality Traits of Artificial Intelligences in Social Card Games

A simple card game based on proposing and guessing numbers, with either rewards or punishments being dealt based on one players intrinsic understanding of one another. The AIs navigate this space by having two main components; player models and the ability to deliberate. The player models store personal attributes (such as trust or deceitfulness), and the argumentation in deliberation allows players to influence others’ model of another player.

### Room Placement in Public House Floor Plans

A method for automated generation of floor plans of the modern-day British-style pub to be used in computer graphics applications. Given the footprint (outline of exterior walls), randomly generated interior walls and a front door, this approach finds the optimal location of the rooms using stochastic hill climbing, calculated by a cost function.
